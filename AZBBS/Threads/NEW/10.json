        "body":"Previous thread: DAS secretary Henry Hamilton has delivered a televised statement insisting that the president is \"alive and well,\" maintaining the offical narrative that Richardson has been on a tour/inspection of national defense systems since July. He added that the communications blackout surrounding the president and his chief of staff remains only a temporary security measure, and assured Congress that Richardson will return to Washington soon to address his impeachment.\n\nThe Executive Office has since released an alleged audio recording of the president delivering essentially the same speech. This comes as tensions with China reach an all-time high, leading many to suspect that the president is bracing for an imminent nuclear exchange.\n\nTry to keep things civil and on topic this time, folks. Speculation is fine, but cut it out with the death rumors."
